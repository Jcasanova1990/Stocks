This starter kit uses Gulp, Webpack, Browsersync, Nodemon and Babel to create a unified development environment with hot reloading and automatically building files to disk. It uses the concept of `Train How You Fight, Fight Like You Train`. Instead of building files in memory in dev mode, this starter kit builds your files directly to the public folder and statically serves the public folder. This means that the public folder is serving your site just like it would in production and this meant to be a simple full stack react starter kit that any learner can build upon.
